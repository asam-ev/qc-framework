# Viewer Interface

## Link with the Interface

As described in the section "Using the ReportGUI" of [Using the Checker
Framework](using_the_framework.md), it is possible to show issues in a 3D
Viewer, if they have a valid position link. In general ASAM Quality Checker
Framework doesn't provide a 3D Viewer but a C-interface to connect your own 3D
Viewer to the ReportGUI. The ReportGUI loads viewer plugins in the form of
shared libraries from the folder `bin/plugin`. A plugin needs to implement the
interface `include/viewer/iConnector.h` and provide it via common C-API
`__declspec(dllexport)` mechanism. The ReportGUI will load the library during
startup and use your viewer to show issues graphically.

The C-interface declares the following functions, which are called by the
ReportGUI:

```c
bool StartViewer();
bool Initialize(const char* inputPath);
bool AddIssue(void * issueToAdd);
bool ShowIssue(void * itemToShow, void* locationToShow);
const char* GetName();
bool CloseViewer();
const char* GetLastErrorMessage();
```

This functions should be implemented inside your 3D viewer library to make your
3D viewer compatible with the Report GUI. If the shared library is not loadable
or one of the functions isn't defined, the ReportGUI will show an error and the
viewer won't be available.

It is not possible to implement and start multiple viewers. Starting a second
viewer automatically closes the currently active one. A viewer is started via
the context menu **File -> Start Viewer**.

If you start a viewer the following functions are called in this order:

1. StartViewer
2. Initialize
3. AddIssue (will be called for each issue found)

If an error occurs during the startup process, the ReportGUI will call
GetLastErrorMessage to print out the error in the ReportGUI itself.

ShowIssue is triggered if you click on a InertialLocation issue in the ReportGUI.
It will send the clicked issue and its location to the viewer.

If the ReportGUI is closed a currently active Viewer receives the closeViewer
call.

## Viewer Example

A demo viewer is provided as source code under `examples/viewer_example`. When
you open the GUI, it looks like in the image above and you can start the viewer
from the File menu. Click on issues that represent a 3D error and find the
function calls inside the console window. Your own viewer interface
implementation can use this information to show the error in 3D.

A fully functioned viewer based on the [esmini simulator](https://esmini.github.io/) 
is also provided as part of the ASAM Quality Checker Framework. Please refer to 
the [esmini viewer plugin](esmini_viewer_plugin.md) for details.
