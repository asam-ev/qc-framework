# How-to Build and Install

The ASAM Quality Checker Framework runs on Linux and Windows.

## Toolchain

- GCC 7.5 or newer compiler under Linux or Visual Studio 16 2019 or newer
  compiler under Windows
- CMake 3.16 or newer (get it here: <https://cmake.org/download>)

## 3rd Party Dependencies

- Xerces-C++
- Qt 5
- **Optional:** GoogleTest (only if tests are enabled)

Links to download the sources and the tested versions can be found in the
[license information appendix](licenses/readme.md).

## 3rd Party Data File Dependencies

- ASAM OpenDRIVE XML Schema files (*.xsd) (request download here:
  <https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/opendrive>).

  Currently supported versions are:
  - 1.1
  - 1.2
  - 1.3D
  - 1.4H
  - 1.5M
  - 1.6.1
  - 1.7.0

- ASAM OpenSCENARIO XML Schema files (*.xsd) (request download here:
  <https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/openscenario>).

  Currently supported versions are:
  - 0.9.1
  - 1.0.0
  - 1.1.0
  
The XSD files are required for the basic test of validating the formal
correctness of a OpenDRIVE or OpenSCENARIO file. All ASAM files are free of
charge and require only a valid email address to enable the download.

## Preparation

Before we can proceed to build and install the software, we need to setup all
3rd party dependencies. Download, build and install the above listed.

After the download of at least one ASAM OpenDRIVE and one ASAM OpenSCENARIO
specification the XSD files from the archives need to be placed in some
arbitrary folders. Older versions have only a single XSD file, whereas newer
versions have multiple files. Nevertheless, extract all XSD files into an empty
folder. After a successful installation of the ASAM Quality Checker Framework
this folder can be deleted.

## Build

- Use CMakeLists.txt within the main directory as source directory
- Do not forget to set `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`
- Do not forget to set `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` if using CMake generator `Unix
  Makefiles`

For Windows Visual Studio 16 2019 an example CMake call to build the framework
looks like this (call from the repository root):

```bash
$ mkdir ../build
$ cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A "x64" -T "v142" -B../build -S. ^
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<prefix>" ^
    -DENABLE_FUNCTIONAL_TESTS=ON ^
    -DGTest_ROOT="<gtest_root>" ^ 
    -DASAM_OPENDRIVE_XSD_DIR="<asam_opendrive_xsd_dir>" ^
    -DASAM_OPENSCENARIO_XSD_DIR="<asam_openscenario_xsd_dir>" ^ 
    -DXERCES_ROOT="<xerces_c_root>" ^
    -DQt5_ROOT="<qt5_root>"
$ cmake --build ../build --target ALL_BUILD --config Release
$ ctest --test-dir ../build -C Release
$ cmake --install ../build
```

With the following CMake values:

- _\<prefix\>_: The prefix CMake installs the package to
- _\<GTest_ROOT\>_: The root dir of the pre-built GoogleTest package
- _\<asam_opendrive_xsd_dir\>_: The directory containing the schema (*.xsd)
  files for OpenDRIVE downloaded from the ASAM website (multiple versions of
  the schema files in this directory are supported).
- _\<asam_openscenario_xsd_dir\>_: The directory containing the schema (*.xsd)
  files for OpenSCENARIO downloaded from the ASAM website (multiple versions of
  the schema files in this directory are supported).
- _\<xerces_c_root\>_: The root dir of the pre-built Xerces-C++ package
- _\<Qt5_ROOT\>_: The root dir of the pre-built qt5 package

### Options

| Name | Value | Description | Remarks |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- | ------- |
| ENABLE_FUNCTIONAL_TESTS | ON/OFF | choose whether the tests were created in the building process of the libraries or not | dependency to a valid gtest package needed (see <https://github.com/google/googletest>) |
