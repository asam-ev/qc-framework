## Usage

The plugin checks the input file pointed by the xqar file you are inspecting:

- If it is an OTX file, the plugin does not show anything
- If it is an ODR file, the plugin shows it
- If it is an OSC file, the plugin get the correspoding openDRIVE file from the input openSCENARIO and shows that road network

Currently the plugin has only the functionality of showing the road network and it is presented for demonstration purposes.
